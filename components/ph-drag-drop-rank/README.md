ph-drag-drop-rank
================

This is one element in a series of different survey elements. It were build as part of my 
computer science master thesis. If you have any suggestions, bugs or some trouble (also if
the source code will not follow some best practices in web components or polymer) please
contact me, open an issue or make a pull request with the improved code.

At the moment there is no save() or load() method to get or set the state of the matrix. This
will follow up next.
